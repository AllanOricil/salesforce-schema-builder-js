# salesforce-schema-builder-js

My idea was to replace that old salesforce schema builder, that seems to have been built in the 90s, with something more beautiful and modern.
I built the whole canvas-js framework, this library and the application to build schemas.

This library was created to draw Salesforce Database Schemas. You can check a demo I built in the links below:
